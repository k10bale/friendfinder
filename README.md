# friendfinder

#App that matches you up with others based on comparing your survey score results with others stored in the api friends page.
The home page has a button, which when clicked takes you to the 10 question survey.

You first must give your name and a valid link to your photo.

Each question is based on an answer scale of 1-5. 1 being the highest level of disagreement, and 5 the highest level of agreement for each statement provided.

All 12 of these fields are required, otherwise request will not go through.

After hitting submit, a modal will pop up showing the photo and name of your best match. You will then just close it out, or choose to fill out the survey again if you are not satisified with your match.

Your results will then be added as an object to the friends API page.
